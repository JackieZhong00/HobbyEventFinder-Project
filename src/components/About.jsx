        <h3>Why I created this app</h3>
        <p>I've always loved meeting new people, making friends and discovering fun hobbies along the way. As I'm growing older, this love of mine started to become much more difficult to reach,
             as there's no longer a classroom or commitment that regularly facilitates these interactions, without my input in creating these environments from scratch. In hopes of
             bringing similar minded people together, as well as giving myself more convenient opportunities to meet people, I've created this application for everyone to use.
